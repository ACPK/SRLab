Single image super resolution algorithm implementation (in progress)

Project URL:http://shaofeng_2010.gegahost.net/SR/SingleImgSR.html

Example:

image = Image.open("test_data/babyface_4.png")
sr_image = SRImageFactory.create_sr_image(image)
reconstructed_sr_image = sr_image.reconstruct(2, 'iccv09')
reconstructed_sr_image.save("test_data/babyface_sr.png", "png")

Need to work more on performance, it will take around six minutes to reconstruct a 200*200 image to
2X its original size, and take around 36 minutes to 4X its original size.(On i7 Cpu, 8G ram)
